# Python-Flow-Cytometry-Analysis

This project was done to visualize data from Flow Cytometry experiments run in Summer 2019 in the Kueh Lab (UW Seattle Dept. of Bioengineering).

This experiment was done to see the effects of overexpressing certain transcription factors in activated immune cells. The results were presented in laboratory meetings and showed interesting results regarding two specific transcription factors (TCF-7 and Tbx-21).
